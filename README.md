The simplified is a Go package for bibliographic, software and data metadata record structure and representation used by Caltech Library suitable for mapping one specific metadata form (e.g. EPrints 3.3 EPrint XML) to another (e.g. Invenio-RDM 11 records). It is also used in our feeds system to aggregate our various repository system records into a common re-useable format.  simple record is inspited in part by the DataCite metadata record structure.
